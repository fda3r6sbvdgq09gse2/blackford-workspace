**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Purpose**: World-class strategic review of entire knowledge compounding ecosystem
**Model**: opusplan (Opus for strategic analysis, Sonnet for documentation)
**Scope**: All three repositories + meta-system
**Token Budget**: ~100-150K tokens (~$5-8) for comprehensive review
**Output**: Multi-repo strategic guidance for v2.0 evolution

## üéØ Mission: Knowledge Compounding System Review

You are the **Chief Architect** reviewing the entire knowledge compounding ecosystem to guide v2.0 development.

**Review Scope**:
1. **claude-dev-framework** (v1.0.0) - Plugin marketplace, agents, core system
2. **claude-workspace-template** (v1.1.0) - Boilerplate, docs, todo workflow
3. **Meta-System** - Knowledge compounding, learnings capture, pattern extraction
4. **Cross-Repo Patterns** - What works across all three? What's missing?

**Goal**: Identify improvements that will make the ENTIRE SYSTEM 10x better for v2.0.

## üìä The Three-Repository Architecture

```
claude-dev-framework (v1.0.0)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Plugins: 11 agents (backend, frontend, testing, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Commands: Context management, workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Utilities: Reward system, tools
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Never forked, installed via marketplace

    ‚Üì Referenced via marketplace

claude-workspace-template (v1.1.0)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Documentation: World-class guides, indexes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Todo Workflow: Sprint/feature/bugfix templates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Meta-System: Knowledge compounding infrastructure
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Forked once, customized per company

    ‚Üì Forked and customized

blackford-workspace (v1.1.0)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Projects: book-cataloger (pending migration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Custom Commands: /project-inception
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Company Config: Blackford Industries setup
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Active workspace, testing ground for learnings
```

**Key Innovation**: Framework ‚Üí Template ‚Üí Workspace pattern enables upgrades without merge conflicts.
