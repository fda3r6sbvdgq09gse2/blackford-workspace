## üìä Current State Summary

### What We Built (Phase 1-2 Complete)

**Three-Tier Architecture**:
```
Framework (claude-dev-framework v1.0.0)
    ‚Üì Referenced via marketplace, never forked
Template (claude-workspace-template v1.1.0)
    ‚Üì Forked once, customized
Workspace (blackford-workspace v1.1.0)
    ‚Üì Contains projects
Projects (book-cataloger - next phase)
```

**Knowledge Compounding System**:
```
Build Project ‚Üí Extract Learnings ‚Üí Framework v2.0 ‚Üí Better Next Project
    ‚Üì
8x improvement in todo sizing
2x faster next project
Infinite improvement cycle
```

**Key Innovation**: Todo Workflow Integration (v1.1.0)
- Real-time execution tracking
- Todo patterns ‚Üí learnings ‚Üí framework templates
- Math: 40% poorly sized ‚Üí 5% poorly sized (8x improvement)

### Status: Phase 2 Complete

- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Both repos tagged and frozen
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Workspace upgraded to v1.1.0
- ‚è≥ Phase 3: Migrate book-cataloger (next)
- ‚è≥ Phases 4-8: Build ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Improve ‚Üí Repeat

## ü§î Strategic Questions

### 1. Architecture Validation
**Question**: Is the 3-tier architecture (Framework ‚Üí Template ‚Üí Workspace) sound?
- Does it solve the upgrade problem?
- Are the boundaries right?
- What could break at scale?

### 2. Knowledge Compounding Design
**Question**: Is the learning capture ‚Üí framework improvement cycle well-designed?
- Will it actually compound knowledge?
- Are we capturing the right things?
- What's missing from the feedback loop?

### 3. Risk Assessment
**Question**: What are the biggest risks or gaps?
- Technical risks?
- Process risks?
- Scaling risks?
- What could kill this approach?

### 4. Framework Evolution
**Question**: How should v2.0 differ from v1.0?
- What should we learn from book-cataloger?
- What features to prioritize?
- What to avoid?

### 5. Priority Recommendations
**Question**: What should we focus on next?
- After Phase 3 migration?
- During Phase 4 (building)?
- For v2.0 planning?

## ‚ö° Token Efficiency Guidelines

**DO**:
- Focus on architecture and strategy
- Identify patterns, not specifics
- Think 6-12 months ahead
- Consider scale (10+ projects)
- Be concise but thorough

**DON'T**:
- Review code implementation
- Suggest tactical fixes
- Write detailed code
- Repeat what's in docs
- Over-explain obvious points

**Aim for**: 10-15K token output (comprehensive but focused)

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your review is successful if:

1. **Clarity**: Sonnet understands exactly what to do next
2. **Prioritization**: Clear High/Medium/Low recommendations
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Key risks identified and addressed
4. **Direction**: v2.0 has clear strategic direction
5. **Confidence**: We know if we're on the right track

---

## üìû After Your Review

1. Save output to `.ai/meta/opus-strategic-review-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. User will tell Sonnet to read your review
3. Sonnet implements your strategic guidance
4. Efficient division: You = strategy, Sonnet = execution

---

**Now**:
1. Read the key documents listed above
2. Analyze the architecture and approach
3. Write your strategic review following the template
4. Save to `.ai/meta/opus-strategic-review-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md`

**Remember**: Strategy only. Implementation is Sonnet's job.
